# SendMailPSForm.ps1

I was asked from a small Business Company to create an easy way for the Administration, to create default Email for
new Employees. Admin Team had no expirience with PowerShell but the Text was random only Usernames and Phonenumbers
Were Variable.
For that I wrote a small Powershell Script which opens a Windows where you can write in the Variables and when you push
send Button it will send an Email over your Outlook. By sending in this way over the local Outlook I made sure that
there will be no send permission issue.
You can download it here if your interessted in it.
